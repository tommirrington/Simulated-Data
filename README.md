# The London Bicycle Hire Scheme Usage

The London Bicycle Hire scheme or the 'Boris' bikes is a public transport alternative that has been in use in London since 2010.  This investigation looks at the cycle hire usage over time and the variables that affect its use. A synthetic dataset has been built based on these observations.  The investigation can be viewed by opening the file Simulated_Data.ipynb in Github or by downloading the file and using Jupyter notebook.
